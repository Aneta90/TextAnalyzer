The job of a pilot is difficult and risky, but prestigious. Airline pilots often travel thousands of kilometers and can find themselves in a different time and climate zones every day. They see all parts of the world and get to know new people almost all the time. But a pilot also faces problems. They often suffer from jet lag and can become tired when flying through different time zones. They spend many days away from home and their families. Although many people think it is a real dream job pilots must be responsible people because they have the lives of up to a few hundred passengers in their hands. They have to have hundreds of hours of training before they can do their job. Pilots must remain calm in dangerous situations and always have to make the right decisions. They need to see and hear perfectly. About 60 % of all pilots fly commercial airplanes, the rest fly cargo and private planes, as well as air force planes.There are many things that a pilot must do before he or she flies a plane. They must check out weather conditions on the flight path and around the landing area. They also have to check flight plans, fill in forms and do a lot of paperwork. Before takeoff pilots brief their crew and do a complete check of the airplane to see if everything works the way it should. Pilots must calculate how much fuel they have to take with them.
